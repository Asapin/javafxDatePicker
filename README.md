A JavaFX widget for picking dates.

This is based on code originally by Christian Schudt. See his blog post [here](http://myjavafx.blogspot.ch/2012/01/javafx-calendar-control.html).

It was slightly modified by Marco Jakob as described [here](http://edu.makery.ch/blog/2013/01/07/javafx-date-picker/)
